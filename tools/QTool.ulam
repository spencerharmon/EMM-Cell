  A tool is an element that helps a simulation operator test, guide, or influence a simulation using elements that are exernal to the normal operation of an EMM Cell. QTools are never to be created by any other elements. They are for operator use only.
  This exists to add some conveniences to the group of elements that constitute tools.
